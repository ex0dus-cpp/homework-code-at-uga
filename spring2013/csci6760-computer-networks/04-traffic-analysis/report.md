    The user didn't click on any link. Links are normally a GET request.
    But we only have several GET requests with Referer information, and
    all of those GET requests are generated by javascript, or loading
    static resources like CSS/JavaScript/image files

    172.16.0.101

4. How many TCP connections are there in this trace?

    31, using filter command `tcpdump -r site1.dump 'tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-ack) == (tcp-syn|tcp-ack)' -nn|wc -l`

5. What is the purpose of the connection to 65.242.27.31?

    Loading an advertisement javascript code

6. Which company owns 65.55.200.221?

    Microsoft, according to whois information

7. What is the purpose of the connection to 143.215.203.39?

8. How many data packets (payload has non-zero amount of data) are used to deliver the root html page?

    14

## Trace2 (site2.dump)
    1. What is the purpose of the connection to 143.215.203.17

        Loading static resources like CSS/JavaScript/image files. This
        should be a CDN site.

        <http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/modules/home/home.asp?4>
        on <http://www.nytimes.com> (or there's an iframe on
        <http://www.nytimes.com>)

    3. What is the purpose of the connection to 4.71.104.187

        Loading nessesary JavaScript files from
        <http://amch.questionmarket.com>, to display advertisement on
        <http://www.nytimes.com>

## Trace3 (site3.dump)

    1. Please infer the user's activities

        The user searched "athens, ga" on Google Maps, then tries to
        search "Galileo"

    2. Why some of the packets have a TCP checksum error?

        The underlining IP packet has checksum of 0x0000.

        According to wiki page of WireShark, it says:

        If you are experiencing network problems and while trying to
        figure it out with Wireshark you found these checksum errors,
        you may have a network card with TCP checksum offload enabled
        and for some reason the packet is not being fixed by the adapter
        (NAT, bridge or route redirection is sending the packet to
        another interface). In this case, you may want to check and
        disable checksum offload for the adapter, if possible.

        This maybe the reason of checksum error.
