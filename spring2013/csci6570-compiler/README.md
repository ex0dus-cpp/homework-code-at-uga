## Lexer

### Build

run `make` in the source code root directory

### Run

I wrote two different lexer, one in C, one in Python.

For the C version: run `./tjc XXX.java` at the source code root
directory.

For the Python version: run `python pylexer.py` at the source code root
directory.

## Parser

TBD
